A fixed point number means there are a fixed number of  digits after the decimal, and a floating point allows for a varying number of digits after the decimals. 
The advantage of using a floating point number is that it can support a wider range of very large and very small values compared to fixed point.
A disadvantage of using a floating point number is that you have to use more memory to store the varying amount of decimals and because the decimals are not uniform you can lose precision after calculations.
